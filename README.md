# AdoPet
This is WT Project performed under Techsakhsam
-- “Adopet” is a web-based platform designed to streamline the pet adoption process. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the application offers users a seamless interface to browse pets available for adoption and submit requests. These requests are reviewed by an admin, who has the authority to approve or decline them.

-- The platform integrates email notifications to inform users about the status of their requests, providing pet details upon approval. The system emphasizes simplicity, transparency, and efficiency in the adoption process. Future iterations aim to expand its functionalities with additional features like real-time chat and AI-driven pet recommendations.
